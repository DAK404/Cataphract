BuildSigner.java

argument processing - enable logging of signing the files

Tools

argument processing - enable compile status logging and option to not sign the build

To pass arguments to a batch file, you can use the %1, %2, %3, and so on, variables. These variables represent the first, second, third, and so on, command-line arguments passed to the batch file 1. For example, if you have a batch file named test.cmd and you want to pass two arguments admin and P@55w0rd to it, you can run the following command:

test.cmd admin P@55w0rd > test-log.txt

In this case, %1 will be replaced with admin, and %2 will be replaced with P@55w0rd. You can use these variables in your batch file to perform operations based on the passed arguments 1.
If you want to pass more than nine arguments to a batch file, you can use %* variable. This variable represents all the command-line arguments passed to the batch file after the ninth argument 1.

ABRAXIS LOGIC:

s = s.replaceAll("/", Matcher.quoteReplacement(File.separator));

Using JDBC driver 3.43.0.0 -> newer ones require an extra lib to be present

TODO

-> Add the option of an administrator account able to delete a normal user account
-> Add the option of Administrator account being able to delete ANY kind of user
-> Reuse the file management system methods for file deletion than to keep reimplementing the same code over and over again.
